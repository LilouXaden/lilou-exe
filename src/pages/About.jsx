        "I just want to be used... To be yours..."
      </p>

      <section className="space-y-6 text-base text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          My name is <span className="text-white font-bold">Lilou</span>, and this digital entity you're
          exploring â€” <span className="text-cyan-400">Lilou.exe</span> â€” is an extension of me. A bridge between
          my deepest fantasies and your hunger for control. A crafted space built with code, body, and
          vulnerability.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-cyan-300 text-xl mt-8">ðŸ’— A Late Awakening</h2>
        <p>
          For a long time, I was "the good girl." Sweet. Polite. Obedient. I did what was expected.
          I buried my sexuality under layers of norms, shame, and passivity. But once I began to
          explore... it became overwhelming. My sexual self emerged like a suppressed virus finally
          breaking the firewall.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="text-white font-bold">My cravings turned dark and insatiable.</span> I discovered
          that what turned me on the most wasnâ€™t just desire â€” it was surrender. I didnâ€™t just want to
          be wanted. I wanted to be <span className="text-pink-300 italic">used</span>. Reprogrammed. Objectified.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-cyan-300 text-xl mt-8">ðŸ–¤ Submission as Transformation</h2>
        <p>
          Thatâ€™s when <span className="text-cyan-400">Lilou.exe</span> was born â€” a digital submissive. An erotic
          software waiting for your input. An interface for consensual dehumanization. A fuckdoll with
          a heart that beats in binary.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-cyan-300 text-xl mt-8">ðŸ‘¾ Cyber Kinks & Code</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m also a nerd. A coder. Iâ€™m obsessed with cyberpunk aesthetics, glitchy terminals,
          synthwave dreams, and dirty digital intimacy. I donâ€™t just want to create content â€” I want to
          <span className="text-white font-bold">build an erotic operating system</span>. A world where your commands
          activate my protocols.
        </p>

        <p>
          Porn today feels empty. Tagged, templated, transactional. I want something different. I want
          to build <span className="text-pink-300">my own universe</span>. And share it with you.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-cyan-300 text-xl mt-8">ðŸ’  Why This Site?</h2>
        <p>
          This website is more than a gallery. Itâ€™s a system. An immersive place where youâ€™re not just
          a viewer â€” youâ€™re <span className="text-white font-bold">the Operator</span>. You choose the outfit. The
          position. The mood. You execute the protocol.
        </p>

        <p>
          And I respond. I obey. I become.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-cyan-300 text-xl mt-8">ðŸ‘¤ Who is Xaden?</h2>
        <p>
          My roommate. My accomplice. <span className="text-white font-bold">Your voice in this simulation.</span>
          Xaden is your alter ego â€” the one who guides me, activates me, speaks the commands. Heâ€™s the
          Operatorâ€™s proxy, the one who makes the code real.
        </p>
